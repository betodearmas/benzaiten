<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naa NA NA Naaa NA NA Naa NA NA NA NA NA! Man, these cats are fuckin' GOOD!! My first favorite Tokyo band. I imagine this is what the 
first people who ever saw the White Stripes play, in some Detroit basement, felt as they inexplicably found themselves singing along the notes to their titular 
tune. Initially we were all drooling over the sexy drummer, dressed in a thrifted pastel-beige colored dress, accented by frizzy bangs and red lipstick, while the 
chicks couldn't take their eyes of the guitar player as he wailed on his guitar rolling around on the sticky floor in black and white stripes - perhaps a conscious 
choice and a reference to their self-awareness as a rocking duo. Our groupie dreams of rockstar fandom loving were soon crushed as we found out a few gigs later 
that they are married! A good ol' fashioned family band.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something about a two-piece band that makes me feel like that's all you really need, if you're good enough. I was impressed by the 
huge sound, even though they are just two people they filled the entire space with sweet sweet rock. Their heavy riffs surging like lighting about the room, like a 
Scott Pilgrim sequence, penetrating, uniting the dispersed energy of a tuesday night open mic crowd. They recently put out their first song "Go My Way!" and some 
demo version stuff is on their YouTube. Being from Osaka, the two were quick to allow me my acquaintanceship, and I've been a fan ever since. It's the kind of music 
that, even if you've never heard a rock song in your life, and had no such inclination, they would turn you over without your consent and you can now call yourself 
a rock fan. That's how powerful their music is. Simple, yet at times complex, and catchy as hell, they are bare bones rock and roll. As for the name FUQA (which
seems to be spelled FU QA on some of their socials) it's a mistery. FUQA. Just sounds good.<br><br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a clip from them playing at Ruby Room, my favorite song from them "na!na!na!". Like, JUST LISTEN TO THAT SHIT!!!!! Holy fuck 
they are the perfect house party band. I think I'll throw a party at my house just to hear them play again lol. But, actually they are pretty active around the 
Tokyo area. If you are nearby I totally recommend you check them out.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this clip just really doesn't do justice to the vibe these guys put on. You need to be there, you need to feel the air vibrating with sound. If you are like me, maybe you thought "hey, why no bass though?", but man, it's one of the few instances where I think it's actually just 
perfect as is. As a bass player myself it's a rare thing, I always think you need that extra meat, that oomph, but in this case, these two beautiful people really 
go all the way in their little two-person seater car, blasting off into on-stage mania.<br>
