This is a blog I've made using only HTML, JavaScript, and CSS

I am only a couple of steps away from completing it. I just have to do a couple more tweaks, namely:
  1) Figure out how to store user data on a server to collect subscriber emails
  2) And to store user comments at the bottom of each article
