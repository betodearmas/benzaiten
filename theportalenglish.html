<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something about a two-piece band that makes me feel like that's all you really need, if you're good enough. I was impressed by the 
    huge sound, even though they are just two people they filled the entire space with sweet sweet rock. Their heavy riffs surging like lighting about the room, like a 
    Scott Pilgrim sequence, penetrating, uniting the dispersed energy of a tuesday night open mic crowd. They recently put out their first song "Go My Way!" and some 
    demo version stuff is on their YouTube. Being from Osaka, the two were quick to allow me my acquaintanceship, and I've been a fan ever since. It's the kind of music 
    that, even if you've never heard a rock song in your life, and had no such inclination, they would turn you over without your consent and you can now call yourself 
    a rock fan. That's how powerful their music is. Simple, yet at times complex, and catchy as hell, they are bare bones rock and roll.<br><br>
