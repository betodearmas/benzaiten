<h1>WELCOME TO BENZAITEN</h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;こんにちは！So, I’ve been meaning to do this for a long, long time, by which I mean randomly spew out my 
    own thoughts on the internet just like literally EVERYONE ELSE. However, I intend to do it in a more structured fashion, 
    and for a specific purpose. For everything else, there’s Facebook.<br><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what’s this all about? Benzaiten is actually the name of the Japanese goddess of music and art (yeah, 
    that’s her in the picture), which I thought an appropriate name for this page since it will basically be me reviewing local 
    Japanese artists’ music albums, etc. that you can see locally in Tokyo. I've been living here for about 9 years now, and I am an 
    active member of the music community both foreign and local. This is my small way to give back, and also to expand the reach of 
    so many underrated and simply unknown amazing artists that exist here. Anyway...<br><br>
    
    ...at least once a week (hopefully) I will upload a review of an album from a local artist that you 
    can actually go and see in Tokyo right now, and I will also try to connect their socials and things like that so you guys can 
    stay updated with the latest happenings, releases, shows, all things of the bands you like the most. I think probably with a 
    quick internet search you’ll be able to listen to most of the stuff I will review on here anyway, BUT (not?) surprisingly 
    there’s tons of Japanese music that actually isn’t on the internet: 1) because their music industry is mainly domestic, 
    and 2) because they still have a huge physical copy-based music industry, ie. people actually still buy CD’s here. So lots 
    of bands are not really that easy to find. Cue this blog.<br><br>
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you’re interested in knowing for fun or if you actually wanna know more about Japanese music and 
    just general pop-culture this blog is for you! I’ll be covering mostly pop/rock and all of it’s sub-genres although there are 
    certainly some that I avoid like more mainstream pop groups are that are nearly indiscernible from one another, with the 
    occasional exception. However, I will try to keep my limits broad, if not completely remove them, eventually. I also encourage 
    my readers to comment and let me know if there’s any kind of artist or genre that they’d like to see featured.
    Unfortunately, maybe, I neither can nor want to pay for a real blog, but for all intents and purposes, this will do. Fortunately, 
    I am teaching myself how to code just to be able to do these fun projects! Leaning on the support that one or two chu-hais, and 
    the sporadic cup of sake and the inspiration it would hopefully bring me, I will try to review as broadly but also specifically 
    as possible, trying to choose the kind of artists I think foreign audiences might like to hear, and trying to choose the kind of 
    music that I should have liked someone to introduce to me! Let’s hope I don’t get bored too soon…
    Anyway, I’ll be keeping up with this, so stay tuned!!
